## My process

Firstly I fetched my json data and rendered it. Then I coded filter functions with add and delete tech stack possibility.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Task completed in 15 hours. I learned how to add functions inside my createElement template (to add multiple elements) and how to destructure elements from an object. I needed few hours to think how to implement filter function, that was a main challenge here. I'm quite happy with my solution.
